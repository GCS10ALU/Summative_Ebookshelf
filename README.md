# E-BOOKSHELF

E-BookShelf is a collaborative project to create an online platform tailored specifically for students to access a diverse range of digital books. With eBook Shelf, our goal is to provide students with a convenient and engaging way to explore literature, whether it's for academic purposes, personal enjoyment, or simply to expand their horizons. By harnessing the power of Python programming, we aim to develop a user-friendly interface that offers features such as book categorization, personalized recommendations, and seamless reading experiences.

### FEATURES
To achieve the desired functionality for our program, we will implement the following features/functions described below;

1. Welcome Function: This function serves as the entry point for users, providing a friendly introduction to eBook Shelf and guiding them through its features and functionalities.
2. Bookshelf Display: Using Python's capabilities, this function dynamically presents a curated collection of eBooks categorized by genre, making it easy for students to discover new titles aligned with their interests.
3. Read Function: Leveraging Python's file handling capabilities, students can read eBooks directly within the terminal using command-line reading functionalities, providing a seamless reading experience without leaving the CLI environment.
4. Main Function: This function will serve as the backbone of eBook Shelf, orchestrating the seamless integration of various features and functionalities to deliver an immersive and enjoyable reading experience for students.

#### RUNNING THE APPLICATION 

1. Users will interact with the online school shell library through the terminal.
   a. Users will be welcomed to the system and presented with an introduction to the functionalities and guidelines of our school library system.
      i. This is an example of how it will look like: 
            1. Read a book
            2. Record a book
            3. Exit
      ii. If a user chooses to (1) Read a book, they will be presented with the following interface with the following options.
            1. A user will be presented with a list of books containing names of the books, authors, and the ISN number of the book. E.g., 1. When the Breath Becomes Aire by Paul Kalanithi. 
            2. A user will also be provided an interface to input to choose the ISN number of book that they want to read a book from the list.
            3. After inputting the number of the book, a user will be able to read the book via the terminal.
            4. If the user finishes reading the book, the user will be asked if she wants to continue reading, record a book, or exit.
            5. The system will take the user to the appropriate section depending on the input provided in point (4).
      iii. If the user chooses 2 (Record a book), the user will be presented with the interface that asks her the:
            1. The name of the book >> the user will provide input
            2. The name of the author >> the user will provide input
            3. The content of the book >> The user will also provide input
            4. The system will save and record that book, and the user will be asked to go to the menu in (i) again and so forth.
